# Assessment 3 - Express/Mongoose

This is the third assessment of the semester.  We're doing this primarily to help us understand how well you've absorbed.  Don't stress out that we will be using this test to judge you in any way except to understand how we can better help you.

To this end—and perhaps it goes without saying—we ask that you don't help each other or cheat.

## Resources

The following resources are **not** allowed:

* Existing code you've already written.
* Solution code or code from learnDot.

The following resources are allowed:

* Any notes you've taken so far.
* All the slide decks that we've used in class.
* Online docs and resources—but do not copy over any code.

## Things we're testing

* Express App Structures 
* Express Routing and Route Methods
* Mongoose Model Configuration

## Starting

1. Clone your fork to your local machine.
2. `npm install`
3. Make sure your MongoDB database is running!
4. You can run `npm test` which will continuously run the test suite on file saves.
5. Read through the project structure, you'll be primarily working in `models/article.js` and  `routes/index.js` in that order.
6. Start working through the tests in `test/`.  You have to mark them as active (from pending) by changing `xit` to `it`
7. `git commit` often as you make progress on the tests.

These tests include [supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest).

## Submitting

As you complete each answer (or make an update), please commit the changes to the git repository.  To submit your answers:

1.  Push your repository back to your own personal fork of `assessment-express-mongoose`.
2.  Download the zip of your project from Github.
3.  Email the zip with a link to your repository to `instructors+assessment@fullstackacademy.com` before the time assigned as the end of the assessment.
